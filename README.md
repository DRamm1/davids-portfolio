# Acceptacne Criteria
- GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
- WHEN I load their portfolio
- THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
- WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
- THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
- THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
- WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
- THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
- WHEN I click on the images of the applications
- THEN I am taken to that deployed application
- WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
- THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

# Given the above My page works as follows.
------------
- As a sample of previouse work I have created a documents folder within my assests folder. I have then gone ahead and linked it directly to my portfolio for visability. 
- To keep the page simple I decided to not include an additional page for the resume but rather a section within my navigation element to direct users to robust professional appearing resume. 
- I have included a recent photo and my name is displayed visably in the main portion to the left of the header. This brings visability and instant recognition.
- To account for section linking I have included a navigation bar on the right hand side of the header that not only links to addtional sections within the page but also changes based on click for mobile and hover on desktop devices.
- As a section and navigational feature my contact information is also displayed within the page.
- (Once in my work section to meet the criteria of having a heading I decided to make the site visiter hover or click on my work images as an iteractive experiance and to keep my portfolio on their minds, as it should stand out as an implication of it being a bit more of an experiance then the average portfolio.)
- As a feature, I met the critera of increasing image size  and included a change in positioning to the Y axis when the hexagon is hovered over or clicked on. The image then disapears and displayes a link to my work.
- I then made sure all otehr instructions were working and funtional within my page. These being mobile responsiveness dependent on view port, semantic structuring, adding alt tags, having as little redundancies as appropriate. 
--------------------------------------
# Things to Note:
- I do not have original images for all my work as I thought it would be more appropriate to display more skills within my portfolio, so all images that are not mine will have a source below. 
- Some additional applictions displayed within the portfolio are from python command line and fairly basic. As I build up my portfolio those will be replaced with more ambitiouse projects but funtion as a current bookmark of skill and a placeholder for future work.
- All contact infor ccan be clicked and if supported will pull up a promt to call, email or redirects to the given URL.

# How To Use:
Navigate the website via the navigation options in the top right or by scrolling. You can also access the main page via the navigational header or my name in this case.

# Code Style:
To help understand sections better I like to leave a space bettween two obvious, or what I feel to be important sections as a way to easily and visually find the header, body, footer etc...
